~~# BindPad-Classic-bcc~~

~~Forked from https://github.com/jukx/BindPad-Classic~~

~~If you're the original author and want this to be taken down, please contact me.~~

~~Updated to work with TBC Classic.~~

~~Works with WOTLK Classic.~~

~~If there are errors about some new API shit, feel free to fork and correct them. I won't be. I'm an idiot and I don't know shit about Lua or the WoW API.~~

This repo is depricated. A much more talented individual has updated bindpad-classic to work properly with WOTLK Classic (and I assume SoM).
